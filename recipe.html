      <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Cut avocado in half and scoop out flesh as one big piece. Lay the avocado half on its side (the hole should be on its side) and cut in 3-4 large pieces, keeping the shape of the hole in each slice.</li>
          <li>Cut a hole in the center of each slice of bread big enough to fit an avocado slice. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 slices of bread to the skillet and toast on each side, about 2 minutes per side. </li>
          <li>Place avocado slices inside each slice of bread in skillet. Crack an egg into the center of each circle. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
          <li>Cover skillet and cook until the egg is cooked to your desired doneness, about 3-5 minutes. Sprinkle cheese on top of each slice, cover with lid again and cook until the cheese is melted. </li>
          <li>Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
          <li>Garnish with chives.</li>
        </ol>
